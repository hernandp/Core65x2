# Overview of Core65X2

This is a very simple MOS6502 core written in Rust, with the following features:

* All original 6502 opcodes.
* Passes all tests, including BCD operations from https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests
* Provides a decoupled memory interface through trait, allowing MMU, memory-mapped I/O, etc.
* Provides handlers for signalling invalid opcode and software interrupts from external code.

The 'X' in the name is the intention of the author to expand the core emulation to other 6502-family members such as the GTE/Rockwell ones, the 65C02/65S02 from WDC, and the 65CE02/4510 used in the Commodore 65 prototypes.
